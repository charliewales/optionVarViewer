optionVarViewer
===============

Simple UI tool I made for viewing, creating and editing maya optionVarâ€™s, good for testing existing scripts, and very useful for cleaning up vars in mayas optionVar system left behind from all non-used scripts. Also gives access to some of mayas more hidden settings. (be careful with this one)
